## Fake Data Generation
There are two options for generating fake data.
Option 1 provides a set of fake data.
Option 2 provides fake data on request via methods.

### Option 1: NameFake API

If the attribute data_loaded is False, loading the data didnt work.
To access the data, access the Objects attributes.

	fake_person = FakePerson()
	print(fake_person.firstname)

	fake = FakeGenerator()
	print(fake.bank_account_number())
